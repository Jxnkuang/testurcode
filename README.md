# Create Test Cases (For non-coders)

Add your problem(s), sample solution(s), and test cases into their respective .txt files (e.g. problems.txt or sampleSolutions.txt)

## Code Structure (For coders)

App.js: Handles website redirects
Home.js: Defines home page layout and information 
Login.js: Handles user login and account creation
Problem.js: Displays problems and lets users run the code to compare with our test cases 
Note: Before running the app locally, you need to comment out Login.js and Problem.js in the code. These files will only be available on the day of the hackathon

### Run The Website

Type `npm start` into the terminal to view website with local changes or go to testurcode.vercel.app to see deployed website 

#### Pull Requests

Once you've added your changes, create a pull request. I'll (Jiaxin) will review and merge after confirming problem and test cases work!
