# Code Structure (For Coders)

The app is structured as follows:

- **App.js**: Manages website redirects and the overall app structure.
- **Home.js**: Defines the homepage layout and the content displayed.
- **Login.js**: Handles user login and account creation.  
- **Problem.js**: Displays problems and allows users to run their code to compare with the test cases.  
  **Note**: Before running the app locally, comment out `Login.js` and `Problem.js` as these files will only be available on the day of the hackathon.
